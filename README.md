## ⭐ Python Projects ⭐

This repository contains the beginner to intermediate projects developed in python as part of a list of assignments of different courses taken on Udemy and Youtube channels, such as:

- `Automated Software Testing with Python` by **Jose Salvatierra** from **Teclado**
- `Web Developer Bootcamp with Flask and Python in 2023"` from **Teclado**
- `Python Django - Complete Course` from **Dennis Ivy**
- `ArjanCodes Youtube Channel` and
- `Patrick Loeber Channel`

This web apps are built using a Monolithic architecture in `HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Django, Flask, Plotly Dash, Jinja2 and PyTorch`.

## 🚀 My process

- I joined the Udemy course **Web Developer Bootcamp with Flask and Python in 2023"** from **Teclado** to learn web development in Python from zero.
- After understanding the basics of Flask, I started to build an intermediate app called **DevSearch** to learn Django as part of the Udemy course **Python Django - Complete Course** from **Dennis Ivy**. Then I converted this app into Flask to explore more advanced concepts, since it requires file manager, authentication, email server with tokens and much more.
- I also built a **Movie Watch List** app to learn how to use **Plotly Dash** and **PyTorch** to explore the world of data science.
- I built a **Todo List** app to learn how to use **Jinja2** and **Django** to explore the world of web development using class based views.

## 📌 What I Learn

👉 Learn how to develop web apps in `Flask`.  
👉 Learn how to develop web apps in `Django` using class based views.  
👉 learn about integrating `Machine Learning` and `Data Science` concepts in a flask project.  
👉 Learn how to structure a `plotly dash` app using intermediate/advanced design principles in python.  
👉 Learn how to integrate `postgres databases` into python web apps.  
👉 Learn automated testing using `Pytest`, unit tests, integration tests, system tests.  
👉 Learn automated front-end testing using module `Playwright` in python to test the design concepts of an app.  
👉 Learn to plan such huge projects.
